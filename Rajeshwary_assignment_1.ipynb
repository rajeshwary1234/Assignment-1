        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level, easy-to-read programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It’s used in web development, data analysis, automation, machine learning, and more. Python is popular because it’s beginner-friendly, has a large supportive community, a vast library ecosystem, and is highly adaptable across different industries and platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        " - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and runs your Python code line by line, translating it into something the computer can understand and execute immediately, without needing to compile it first.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names. These keywords are part of the Python syntax and define the structure of the language. Examples include if, else, for, while, def, class, and return.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords in Python cannot be used as variable names. They are reserved by the language for specific purposes, like defining control flow or functions. Using a keyword as a variable name will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Mutability in Python refers to whether you can change an object after it's created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable objects can be changed (like lists or dictionaries).\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable objects cannot be changed (like strings or tuples).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - Lists are mutable because they are designed to allow changes, like adding, removing, or modifying elements. This flexibility makes them useful when you need to modify data over time.\n",
        "Tuples are immutable to provide safety and consistency. Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed, which is useful when you need a fixed collection of items that should not be altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "== checks if the values of two objects are the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "is checks if two objects are the same object in memory (i.e., if they refer to the same place in memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional expressions. The three main logical operators are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Returns True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reverses the truth value of a condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. It allows you to change the type of a variable or value, such as converting an integer to a string or a string to a float. There are two types of type casting:\n",
        "Implicit casting: Automatically done by Python when it safely converts one type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit casting: Done manually by the programmer using functions to convert types.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The difference between implicit and explicit type casting is: Implicit type casting: Also known as automatic type conversion, it is done automatically by Python when it safely converts a smaller data type to a larger one, without the programmer's intervention.\n",
        "Explicit type casting: Also known as manual type conversion, it requires the programmer to use specific functions to convert one data type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. They enable the code to execute different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false, helping control the flow of execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. 8 How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. It follows an if statement and is used to check another condition if the previous if or elif conditions were false. It ensures that only one of the conditions in the chain is executed. If none of the conditions are true, the else block (if provided) is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - For loop is used to iterate over a sequence of items. While loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of statements while a condition is true. For loops are designed for iterating over a sequence of items.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n",
        "  - Prefer a while loop when the condition has nothing to do with a collection/array and does not require a set number of iterations. Prefer a foreach or a for loop whenever the loop is related to a collection or array.\n",
